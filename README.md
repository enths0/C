# C File I/O Services

That's my **C File I/O Services** initiative plan as a step-by-step guide and documentation for **future myself**. This will eventually be a collection of simple C programs focused on learning and practicing file input/output operations. The goal here is to get handy with C, especially with the basics of handling files, reading, and writing.

## What I’m Aiming For

The main idea behind this initiative is to dive into **File I/O** and get hands-on experience. By the end of it, I want to:

- Have a solid understanding of C as a programming language and its basic concepts, so the File I/O.
- Learn how to deal with the memory and eventually dive into a more low-level computing/programming experience, if there's such.

## Learning Resources

I’m sharing a few resources that helped me and might be useful for someone who encountered this repository:

### Core Docs used
- [C Programming Documentation (devdocs.io)](https://devdocs.io/c/)  
  Reference for C syntax, library functions, etc..

- [Reference to the core of C constructs (cppreference.com)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language)  

- [GCC Preprocessing Directives](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-14.2.0/gcc/Preprocessing-directives-implementation.html)  
  Preprocessing works in C.
